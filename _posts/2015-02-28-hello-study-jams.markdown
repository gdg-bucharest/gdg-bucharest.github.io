We're very excited - So, it's a great honor to be invited to create an Android Jam. 

Study Jams are an opportunity for students to receive free, in-person guidance and tutoring on the Udacity course in a fun classroom environment. Study Jam sessions are designed around the Udacity course structure, with a weekly session following each lesson (6 lessons), plus two additional weeks for completing and sharing course final projects. Students are expected to come to the Study Jam sessions having completed that week.s Udacity lesson online, so that the Study Jam time may be used to review key concepts, address questions, and work on individual projects. The live community atmosphere and tutoring is designed to help students achieve deeper learning around the concepts taught in the course.
